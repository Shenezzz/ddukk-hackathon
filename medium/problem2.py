2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.


Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"

Output: 1

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.


Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"

Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
